The Challenge
For the next 7 days (1 week straight) we challenge you to:

Write every single day (even when you don’t feel like it or the odds are tight)
Write at a set time each day (we highly recommend mornings, as soon as you wake up)
Write 3 regular-sized notebook pages by hand each day
Put perfectionism aside, just for this activity. Just write anything you want, without overthinking it.
Don’t stop writing until you have your 3 pages.
Don’t re-read it or edit it.
