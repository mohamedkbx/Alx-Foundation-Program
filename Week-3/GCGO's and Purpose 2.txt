Global Opportunity: Agriculture 

The World Bank is seizing the opportunity to implement Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) in countries across the globe.


What is Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)?
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to managing landscapes; cropland, livestock, forests and fisheries.

Climate-Smart Agriculture addresses the interlinked challenges of food security and accelerating climate change. CSA aims to simultaneously achieve three outcomes.

1.Increased productivity: Produce more and better food to improve nutrition security and boost incomes, especially for 75% of the world’s poor population, who live in rural areas and mainly rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.

2.Enhanced resilience: Reduce vulnerability to drought, pests, diseases and other climate-related risks and shocks; and improve capacity to adapt and grow in the face of longer-term stresses like shortened seasons and erratic weather patterns.

3.Reduced emissions: Pursue lower emissions for each calorie or kilo of food produced, avoid deforestation from agriculture and identify ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

The first 2 points speak to opportunities in Agriculture, while the 3rd point addresses Agriculture’s impact on Climate Change.
