powerful ones that can be used individually or together.

- Pomodoro Technique
- Eat the Frog
- Breaking Down the Steps and Spreading Them Over Shorter Work Periods

Say,
 you block out 6 - 8 pm on Monday to Friday in your calendar to complete Week 2 content On Monday, 
the next step would be to 
* break down all the tasks you need to complete during that specific time block and
* decide on what the frog is (i.e. what are the big things to focus on completing first).
- You could prioritize looking at the milestone and test first to get a sense of what they require,
* then go back to the relevant modules to review the context in 25-minute bursts using the Pomodoro technique.

-In summary, managing your time will help you to 

	1) allocate adequate time and 
	2) decide on the order of completion of your most important and urgent tasks.

  Don’t waste precious time doing things that don’t count or matter towards your personal goals. Plan and use your time wisely.

Individual Activity: Own Your Time :

Open your Google Calendar or your preferred time management app.
Schedule the non-negotiable activities that you need to do this week and next week. For example, you can block out your Monday to Friday work hours, school runs, or dinner time with family.
Add an hour or two to do that one thing that gives you joy. It could be anything personal; a show on Netflix, watching the sunset, or catching up with a friend. Yes, add the fun stuff first. They too are important and give you the motivation to do the more difficult bits.
Next, add the times that you plan on spending on your university work. This includes reviewing content, completing activities, Tests, and Milestones, and your Daily 3.
Make sure that key Online Community events are added to your calendar. (You will have received an invitation to add the Community events calendar to your Calendar. Make sure you have accepted it).
If you are in a city with a hub, consult your City Hub calendar and see if there will be any events that you would like to participate in and add them to your calendar. Remember to include transit times.
Add a few contingency hours, in case of an emergency. Life happens, and when it does we want to be sure you have a few set aside to catch up on anything that is thrown off track.
Hopefully, after all this scheduling, you still have gaps in your schedule to do nothing! You can choose to leave the gaps open or add more activities you feel inclined to. Just don’t fill up every single spot on your calendar, so you have some breathing room.
