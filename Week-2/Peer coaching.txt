What is Peer Coaching?

Peer coaching is a type of helping relationship in which two people of equal status help one another with specific tasks or problems,
 using a structured format. Peer coaching can take many forms. But at its simplest,
 it is simply one person playing the role of “coach” while the other is the “coachee.”

-----------------------------------------------
the GROW Model. In this model, the coach asks 4 simple questions of the coachee.

Goal : What is your goal?

Reality: What is the current situation you are dealing with? What is needed to make your goal become a reality?

Options: What are a few things you could do (differently) to get you closer to your goal?

Will/Way Forward: What needs to happen to make it a 10/10 likelihood that you’ll complete your goal?
