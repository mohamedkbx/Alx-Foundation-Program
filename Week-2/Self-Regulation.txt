Self Improvement:

Below, we’ll watch a video by Dr. B. J. Fogg, a psychologist, and innovator who directs the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University. He advocates that the best way to improve yourself and make noticeable, long-term behavior changes is by making incremental, tiny changes in your habits. As you watch, pay attention to:

1-How do long-term tiny incremental behavioural changes impact your habits?
2-What is Fogg’s Format used for?

Ruler Method : 

R -> Recognize 

Ask Yourself: What is your current emotional state at the moment?

Purpose:
 This step is about becoming aware of your emotions as they arise.
 Notice any physical sensations or changes in your mood,
 and acknowledge them without judgment.

U -> Understand

Ask Yourself: What triggered this emotion? Why might I be feeling this way?

Purpose:
 Understanding the root cause of your feelings is essential.
 Consider any recent events, interactions,
 or thoughts that may have contributed to your emotional state.
 Reflect on patterns or past experiences that might influence how you feel.


L -> Label

Ask Yourself: What would you call this feeling you experienced?

Purpose: Accurately labeling your emotions helps in making sense of them. Use specific words to describe your feelings, 
such as “anxious,” “frustrated,” “excited”,
 or “sad.” This clarity can reduce emotional intensity and help you gain perspective.

E -> Express 

Ask Yourself: How would you explain what just happened to someone else to ask for help or share?

Purpose:
 Articulate your feelings to someone else or write them down. 
Sharing your emotions can provide relief and support, 
whether you seek help, feedback, or simply want to vent. 
It also helps you process your emotions constructively.

R -> Regulate

Ask Yourself: What might you be able to do to help you manage this feeling/emotion?

Purpose: Develop strategies to manage and respond to your emotions effectively. 
This could include deep breathing, taking a walk, 
practicing mindfulness, or seeking professional help if needed.
 The goal is to find healthy ways to cope and maintain emotional balance.

Flexibility of RULER :

 Quick or In-Depth: The RULER method can be quick or take longer, depending on what you need at a specific moment. Whether you take a few seconds or a more extended period, the key is to be mindful and intentional in your approach.

Think about a time when you experienced strong emotion.
Transport yourself back to that moment – remember where you were, what just happened, and what you were feeling. Write these elements of that event of time down.
Now, click this intervention article (“Emotional Self-Regulation: RULER method”, BYU) "https://open.byu.edu/addressing_wellbeing/emotional_self_regul" and go through it to get a better understanding of the RULER method and apply it to reflect on this event you just thought of.
Take a piece of paper and go through the questions above, and those listed in the intervention article.
